# Mine Sweeper Solver

This project contains a mine sweeper game with customizable size, 5 different difficulties and a built-in auto-solve feature.

## Instructions

__*Right-Click*__ : Set flag on a given position

__*Left-Click*__ : Reveal content of a given position

Each position may contain one of the following:
- A number, with the number of mines around that position, varying from 1 to 8.
- A mine, if you try to reveal a mine, you lose the game. 
- Nothing, which means that position is a sad position with nothing special on it.
